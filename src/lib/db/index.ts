// --- Build-time resilience -------------------------------------------------
// Many ISR / prerendered pages query the DB during `next build` (static
// export). A single failed query otherwise aborts the WHOLE export, hard-
// blocking the deploy. When the build DB is transiently unreachable (e.g. a
// Neon compute-quota 402 or a brief outage) we don't want a routine deploy to
// die — these pages declare `revalidate` and render empty states gracefully,
// so during the BUILD PHASE ONLY a failed query resolves to an empty result
// set and the page refills on its first runtime revalidation.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow:
//   * Only when NEXT_PHASE === 'phase-production-build' — never at runtime.
//   * drizzle-orm/neon-http binds the query fn ONCE at construction
//     (`this.clientQuery = client.query ?? client`), so we intercept the
//     `.query` *getter* and hand drizzle a wrapped fn. A call/apply trap or a
//     wrapper on the drizzle object would be captured-around and never fire.
//   * At runtime the raw client passes through untouched, so Next.js ISR keeps
//     serving the last-good cache on any revalidation error (safer than baking
//     empties into the export).
// Known limit: only SELECT-list shapes degrade cleanly (→ []). A build-phase
// aggregate that indexes row[0] could still throw — acceptable, since this
// only ever engages during an outage build, which we avoid deploying anyway.
