    overview: [
      "China’s composite grating supply base covers molded panels, pultruded load-bearing panels, stair treads, trench covers and custom-cut assemblies. The first sourcing decision is not factory size but service condition: orthophthalic polyester is common for general industrial walkways, isophthalic systems improve chemical resistance, vinyl ester is selected for aggressive process environments, and phenolic systems are considered when smoke and flame performance dominate. A useful RFQ therefore names the resin family, load case, support span, surface treatment and destination standard instead of asking only for a panel price.",
      "Export-ready factories differ most in their control of glass content, cure, bar geometry, dimensional tolerance and traceability. For molded grating, buyers should confirm mesh pattern, overall depth, load-bar thickness and whether the quoted size is the nominal mold size or the finished cut panel. For pultruded grating, confirm bearing-bar pitch, cross-rod construction and the test basis for published load tables. Australian mining installations frequently require AS 1657 walkway design compliance, AS 4663 slip resistance, and heavy Class D wheel load evidence. For marine and offshore splash zones, salt spray durability tested under ISO 9227 or ASTM B117 protects structural integrity over long immersion cycles. CE documents, ISO 9001 certificates and test reports should always be checked for the legal entity, product scope and validity date rather than accepted as logo files.",
      "GetFRP exposes public company profiles and capability evidence for first-pass comparison. A procurement team can compare documented process, relevant certifications, production region, scale tier and the ability to supply the requested resin and surface before contacting a factory. Once the specification is stable, the sourcing desk can request matched samples, confirm current test evidence and arrange pre-shipment inspection against the same acceptance criteria used in the RFQ.",

Two profiles with the same outside dimensions can have materially different stiffness, strength and durability because glass architecture, veil, resin system, fibre fraction and wall build-up are different.",

North American projects may instead call up ASTM test methods and project-specific allowable values. Buyers should request longitudinal and transverse properties, coupon orientation, conditioning, batch traceability and the exact report behind any published table. Dimensional tolerance and straightness also deserve a separate acceptance table, particularly for long lengths and assemblies.",

SMC is supplied as sheet compound and is suited to larger compression-moulded parts; BMC is a bulk compound often used for smaller, intricate or electrically demanding components. The commercial route depends on whether the buyer needs compound only, toll moulding, tooling plus serial parts, or a fully validated assembly.",
      "A useful RFQ defines mechanical, flame, electrical, dimensional and appearance requirements together with annual volume and validation stage. Filler level, fibre length, resin chemistry, thickening, maturation and storage influence mould flow and final properties. For parts, tool temperature, charge pattern, pressure, cure time and post-mould finishing affect repeatability. Material datasheets should be tied to the offered grade, and part-level evidence should reflect the real thickness and geometry where the requirement is sensitive.",
      "MOQ economics differ sharply between a compound trial and serial moulding. A small BMC formulation trial may be possible with existing equipment, while a new SMC part needs tool design, process trials and capability validation before stable production. GetFRP exposes compound and moulding capability through public profiles, helping buyers separate development cost, tooling ownership, sample approval and recurring part price. That creates a clearer comparison than asking multiple factories for one blended unit price.",

          "SMC is a sheet-form moulding compound with longer chopped reinforcement and is commonly charged into compression tools for larger parts.

A development order should therefore separate trial compound, tool trials and serial production pricing.",
