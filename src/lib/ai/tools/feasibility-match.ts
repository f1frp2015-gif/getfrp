// GetFRP keeps supplier identities private until an RFQ specification is
// locked, so chat results always use anonymized capability references.

// Sourcing Desk · step 2 — "Feasibility & Standards Match".
// Given a buyer's spec (which the concierge extracts from the conversation or an
// uploaded drawing), answers "can a Chinese factory make this, and to which
// standards" against GetFRP's export-ready supply graph. Returns atomic data + an
// explicit caveat (per feedback_ai_tool_atomic_data): a feasibility shortlist,
// NOT a quote — pricing/compliance/final factory are separate steps confirmed by
// the getfrp sourcing team after spec lock. On the overseas side the
// candidates are anonymized (no factory name/province).
